# MonitorDarkener

Monitor Darkener is an app that "dims" or "disables" any selected screens apart from the primary screen.
It disables/dims the screens using a black overlay. So they're not really turned off but they will not display anything.
This is ideal for when watching movies/seires and you don't want to be distracted by your other screens.
